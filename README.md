# Hugo Arriojas' 2024 Portfolio

Here is the Github repo for my portfolio as seen on https://www.hugoa.dev/

I made this to showcase some of the work that I've done and will continue to update it as my career in progresses.

Some next stretch goals I have for this site include:

- Adding details from the work I was able to complete at Mercatus
- Adding projects that are more representative of my current skill
- Showing Hover text for the skills section in order to increase readability
- Adding a "testimonials from LinkedIn" section
- Adding additional aria labels and roles for accessibility

Thank you for checking out my repo!
Please feel free to contact me using any of the links on my site if you have any questions

Built with NextJS, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion

Use `npm run dev` to run site locally and poke around or
`npm run build` followed by `npm start` to get a production build
